# Code for UDA experiments

Before running the code, download the [Office-Home dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B81rNlvomiwed0V1YUxQdC1uOTg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-2SNWq0CDAuWOBRRBL7ZZsw) and modify the root to the dataset at line 219 in train_KPG-RL.py.

To produce the results of Partial-KPG-RL on Office-Home, run  

```bash
sh run_.sh
```

This code was heavily borrowed from [RSDA](https://github.com/XJTU-XGU/RSDA).
